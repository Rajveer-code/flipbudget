"""Item 5 of the latest directive: the complete analysis pipeline for the
preregistered T-C expansion (TC_EXPANSION_PREREGISTRATION.md), written and
tested BEFORE valid labels exist, so a genuine submission runs through this
unchanged the moment it arrives.

Steps (fixed by the preregistration, not decided here):
  0. QUALITY GATE -- the same statistical-signature check that caught the
     two excluded submissions (TC_EXPANSION2_LABELING_QUALITY_ISSUE.md),
     now automated. Refuses to proceed silently; requires an explicit
     --i-confirm-human-labeled flag to override, so a human consciously
     signs off rather than the script making that call on its own.
  1. Recompute alpha (both_credited cell) and beta (both_not_credited
     cell) for exact_match AND score_boxed separately.
  2. Recompute the disagreement-resolution rate from the two disagreement
     cells (does the human tend to agree with exact_match or score_boxed
     when they disagree).
  3. Recompute scorer-identification / audit-estimation / combined
     uncertainty for BOTH scorer targets using the existing, unmodified
     fb_reconcile_layers.py machinery.
  4. Recompute pairwise identification, compare directly against the
     historical 69-row (score_boxed-only) result.
  5. Report the A/B/C/D interpretation strictly from the numbers -- not
     decided in advance.

Run (self-test on synthetic placeholder data):
  python scripts/fb_tc_expansion2_analysis.py --self-test
Run (real submission, after manual review of the quality-gate output):
  python scripts/fb_tc_expansion2_analysis.py --csv labeling/tc_expansion2_l1.csv --i-confirm-human-labeled
